# Create another proxy for the android traffic
# Go to proxy => options => add
# Enter the local ip & a custom port, ie 8081

# Route the traffic through the proxy
# Modify the wifi network and add a proxy

# If you don't trust the apps to follow the proxy rules:
# - do a mitm attach, for example arp spoofing
# - in an emulated android device enable proxying at the virtualization layer

# Export burp's CA certificate
# And push it to the android device
adb push burpca-cert.der /storage/sdcard/Download/cacert.cer

# OR download it inside the android device
# AFTER having set the proxy routing, go to http://burpsuite

# Setup the proxy
# Manually through the network settings in the Android UI
# Or:
adb shell settings put global http_proxy 192.168.0.14:8888
